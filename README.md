# Real-time Speech-non-speech classifier

This matlab classifier aims to distinguish normal speech, abusive/angry/violate speech and environmental noise. The classifier is based on audio features and KNN. Noted, codes for short-term feature extraction is based on Theodoros Giannakopoulos's Matlab Audio Analysis Library (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45831-matlab-audio-analysis-library)

### Prerequisites

Matlab R2015b and higher.
Most bugs in old versions are due to different names of functions. For example, '''wavread''' is used in old version rather than '''audioread'''.

### Installation and running the code

Download my matlab code
```
Give the example
```
Change your Matlab working directory to the folder where you download my code. Open '''main.m''' and press '''run''' button in matlab. A figure will be generated and you can speak to your computer and see performance of this classifier.
